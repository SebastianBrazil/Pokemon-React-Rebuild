Pokemon API React Rebuild

This website is a rebuilding of the Pokemon API website in the React framework.

3/11/24: Created the React project and imported the HTML elements to TSX. Attempted to migrate the JS to TS, was largely unsuccessful. 3/12/24 part 1: Put in a lot more work into the TS, not finished but close. 3/12/24 part 2: got stuck on drill fetching. 3/13/24: Was able to resolve drill fetching, perhaps not in the most efficent way possible but it works. Next is to finish the location fetching and then do the moves and evolution tree. 3/15/24: Finished location fetching. The method I used to do so will have to be used again on the evolution tree. Not looking forward to it.
