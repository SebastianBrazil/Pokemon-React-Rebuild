Pokemon API React Rebuild

This website is a rebuilding of the Pokemon API website in the React framework.

Designed at 1920 by 1080px, 768 by 900px, 425 by 720px. 3/11/24: Created the React project and imported the HTML elements to TSX. Attempted to migrate the JS to TS, was largely unsuccessful. 3/12/24 part 1: Put in a lot more work into the TS, not finished but close. 3/12/24 part 2: got stuck on drill fetching. 3/13/24: Was able to resolve drill fetching, perhaps not in the most efficent way possible but it works. Next is to finish the location fetching and then do the moves and evolution tree. 3/15/24: Finished location fetching. The method I used to do so will have to be used again on the evolution tree. Not looking forward to it. 3/16/24 part one: I worked on displaying the type of the pokemon when I realized how I could make the location population much more simple. It was agonizing to remake but hopefully the refactoring makes the evol tree simpler too. 3/16/24 part 2: Added the abilities, moves, and evolution tree. All that's left is the local storage and the gen-5 check. 3/17/24 part one: I found a bug where the location and evolution tree doesn't update on some pokemon (649) on load, but updates when the input is changed. I don't know what the issue is. 3/17/24 part two: simple check to prevent gen 6 and above from showing. The main things left to do are the local storage for the favorites and fixing that bug for populating. 3/17/24 part three: fixed the population bug. All thats left is the local storage. 3/17/24 part four: 

Peer Review: Xavier Hopkins: Sebastion did a great job on the design of this assignment! Everything looks very clean, and his website is highly functional. Only thing your missing is the favorites function, but other than tht great job!!!
